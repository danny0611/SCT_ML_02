K-mean clustering algo
# Customer Segmentation Using KMeans

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing a **K-means clustering algorithm** to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. Customer segmentation is a crucial step in understanding customer behavior, improving marketing strategies, and increasing business efficiency.

## Problem Statement
Group customers into meaningful clusters using their purchase history. The goal is to help businesses understand different customer segments and tailor their strategies accordingly.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python). It contains details about customer purchases, which serve as the basis for clustering.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing the K-means clustering algorithm

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing, including handling missing values and scaling features.
- Implementation of the K-means clustering algorithm.
- Determination of the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method.
- Visualization of clusters to understand customer segments.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/Customer Segmentation Using KMeans.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd customer-segmentation
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Task_02.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the steps in the notebook to load the dataset, preprocess it, and perform clustering.

## Results
- Identification of distinct customer clusters based on purchase behavior.
- Visualizations to explain the characteristics of each cluster.
